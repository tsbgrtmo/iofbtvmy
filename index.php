But sometimes I ask myself, is it really so important in the end everything that I do, To be honest, I would like to think that my existence is not meaningless,that I also made some contribution to this life.  For example, the state allows to write off the cost of a car, which can actually serve 5 years, as expenses for 4 years.  During this period, production capacity remains unchanged, but the intensity of their use may change.  If you tie together two wooden logs, then they can withstand a load that significantly exceeds the sum of their capabilities separately.  It pissed me off terribly. </em>

Demand is determined by the solvent need of buyers (consumers), and supply is determined by the totality of goods offered by sellers (manufacturers).  - But you are a customer of your supplier,I remarked. </em>
